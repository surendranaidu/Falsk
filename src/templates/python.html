<h2><a id="user-content-q-what-is-python-particularly-good-for-when-is-using-python-the-right-choice-for-a-project" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/surendranaidu/python_logic_interview_questions-/blob/master/README.md#q-what-is-python-particularly-good-for-when-is-using-python-the-right-choice-for-a-project" aria-hidden="true"></a>Q. What is Python particularly good for? When is using Python the "right choice" for a project?</h2>
<p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive, and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently whereas other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</p>
<p>Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language that can be applied to many different classes of problems.</p>
<p>The language comes with a large standard library that covers areas such as string processing like regular expressions, Unicode, calculating differences between files, Internet protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, XML-RPC, POP, IMAP, CGI programming, software engineering like unit testing, logging, profiling, parsing Python code, and operating system interfaces like system calls, file systems, TCP/IP sockets.</p>
<p>Although likes and dislikes are highly personal, a developer who is "worth his or her salt" will highlight features of the Python language that are generally considered advantageous (which also helps answer the question of what Python is "particularly good for". Some of the more common valid answers to this question include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ease of use and ease of refactoring, thanks to the flexibility of Python's syntax, which makes it especially useful for rapid prototyping.</li>
<li>More compact code, thanks again to Python's syntax, along with a wealth of functionally-rich Python libraries (distributed freely with most Python language implementations).</li>
<li>A dynamically-typed and strongly-typed language, offering the rare combination of code flexibility while at the same time avoiding pesky implicit-type-conversion bugs.</li>
<li>It's free and open source! Need we say more?</li>
</ul>
<p>With regard to the question of when using Python is the "right choice" for a project, the complete answer also depends on a number of issues orthogonal to the language itself, such as prior technology investment, skill set of the team, and so on. Although the question as stated above implies interest in a strictly technical answer, a developer who will raise these additional issues in an interview will always "score more points" with me since it indicates an awareness of, and sensitivity to, the "bigger picture" (i.e., beyond just the technology being employed). Conversely, a response that Python is always the right choice is a clear sign of an unsophisticated developer.</p>

What are some drawbacks of the Python language?</h2>
<p>For starters, if you know a language well, you know its drawbacks, so responses such as "there's nothing I don't like about it" or "it has no drawbacks" are very telling indeed.</p>
<p>The two most common valid answers to this question (by no means intended as an exhaustive list) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). CPython (the most common Python implementation) is not fully thread safe. In order to support multi-threaded Python programs, CPython provides a global lock that must be held by the current thread before it can safely access Python objects. As a result, no matter how many threads or processors are present, only one thread is ever being executed at any given time. In comparison, it is worth noting that the PyPy implementation discussed earlier in this article provides a stackless mode that supports micro-threads for massive concurrency.</li>
<li>Execution speed. Python can be slower than compiled languages since it is interpreted. (Well, sort of. See our earlier discussion on this topic.)</li>

We know Python is all the rage these days. But to be truly accepting of a great technology, you must know its pitfalls as well.</h2>
<p>Of course. To be truly yourself, you must be accepting of your flaws. Only then can you move forward to work on them. Python has its flaws too:</p>
<p>Python's interpreted nature imposes a speed penalty on it. While Python is great for a lot of things, it is weak in mobile computing, and in browsers.</p>
<p>Being dynamically-typed, Python uses duck-typing (If it looks like a duck, it must be a duck). This can raise runtime errors.</p>
<p>Python has underdeveloped database access layers. This renders it a less-than-perfect choice for huge database applications.</p>
<p>And even after these pitfalls, of course. Being easy makes it addictive. Once a Python-coder, always a Python coder.</p>
<p>So while it has problems, it is also a wonderful tool for a lot of things.</p>

</div>
<p>Although Python 2 is formally considered legacy at this point,its use is still widespread enough that is important for a developer to recognize the differences between Python 2 and 3.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Here are some of the key differences that a developer should be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Text and Data instead of Unicode and 8-bit strings. Python 3.0 uses the concepts of text and (binary) data instead of Unicode strings and 8-bit strings. The biggest ramification of this is that any attempt to mix text and data in Python 3.0 raises a TypeError (to combine the two safely, you must decode bytes or encode Unicode, but you need to know the proper encoding, e.g. UTF-8)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This addresses a longstanding pitfall for na&iuml;ve Python programmers. In Python 2, mixing Unicode and 8-bit data would work if the string happened to contain only 7-bit (ASCII) bytes, but you would get UnicodeDecodeError if it contained non-ASCII values. Moreover, the exception would happen at the combination point, not at the point at which the non-ASCII characters were put into the str object. This behavior was a common source of confusion and consternation for neophyte Python programmers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>print</code>&nbsp;function. The print statement has been replaced with a print() function</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>xrange</code>&nbsp;&ndash; buh-bye. xrange() no longer exists (range() now behaves like xrange() used to behave, except it works with values of arbitrary size)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>API changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>zip()</code>,&nbsp;<code>map()</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>filter()</code>&nbsp;all now return iterators instead of lists.</li>
<li><code>dict.keys()</code>,&nbsp;<code>dict.items()</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>dict.values()</code>&nbsp;now return 'views' instead of lists.</li>
<li><code>dict.iterkeys()</code>,&nbsp;<code>dict.iteritems()</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>dict.itervalues()</code>&nbsp;are no longer supported.</li>
<li>Comparison operators. The ordering comparison operators (&lt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, &gt;) now raise a TypeError exception when the operands don't have a meaningful natural ordering. Some examples of the ramifications of this include:</li>
<li>Expressions like 1 &lt; '', 0 &gt; None or len &lt;= len are no longer valid</li>
<li>None &lt; None now raises a TypeError instead of returning False</li>
<li>Sorting a heterogeneous list no longer makes sense.</li>
<li>All the elements must be comparable to each other</li>
</ul>

What are some key differences to bear in mind when coding in Python vs. Java?</h2>
<p>Disclaimer #1. The differences between Java and Python are numerous and would likely be a topic worthy of its own (lengthy) post. Below is just a brief sampling of some key differences between the two languages.</p>
<p>Disclaimer #2. The intent here is not to launch into a religious battle over the merits of Python vs. Java (as much fun as that might be!). Rather, the question is really just geared at seeing how well the developer understands some practical differences between the two languages. The list below therefore deliberately avoids discussing the arguable advantages of Python over Java from a programming productivity perspective.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>With the above two disclaimers in mind, here is a sampling of some key differences to bear in mind when coding in Python vs. Java:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dynamic vs static typing: One of the biggest differences between the two languages is that Java is restricted to static typing whereas Python supports dynamic typing of variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Static vs. class methods: A static method in Java does not translate to a Python class method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Python, calling a class method involves an additional<br />memory allocation that calling a static method or function does not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Java, dotted names (e.g., foo.bar.method) are looked up by the compiler, so at runtime it really doesn't matter how many of them you have. In Python, however, the lookups occur at runtime, so "each dot counts".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Method overloading: Whereas Java requires explicit specification of multiple same-named functions with different signatures, the same can be accomplished in Python with a single function that includes optional arguments with default values if not specified by the caller.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Single vs. double quotes. Whereas the use of single quotes vs. double quotes has significance in Java, they can be used interchangeably in Python (but no, it won't allow beginnning the same string with a double quote and trying to end it with a single quote, or vice versa!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getters and setters (not!). Getters and setters in Python are superfluous; rather, you should use the 'property' built-in (that's what it's for!). In Python, getters and setters are a waste of both CPU and programmer time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classes are optional. Whereas Java requires every function to be defined in the context of an enclosing class definition, Python has no such requirement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indentation matters&hellip; in Python. This bites many a newbie Python programmer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Big Picture</p>
<ul>
<li>An expert knowledge of Python extends well beyond the technical minutia of the language. A Python expert will have an in-depth understanding and appreciation of Python's benefits as well as its limitations. Accordingly, here are some sample questions that can help assess this dimension of a candidate's expertise:</li>

What is the difference between range and xrange? How has this changed over time?</h2>
<ul>
<li>As follows:
<ul>
<li><code>xrange</code>&nbsp;returns the xrange object while range returns the list, and uses the same memory and no matter what the range size is.</li>
<li>For the most part, xrange and range are the exact same in terms of functionality. They both provide a way to generate a list of integers for you to use, however you please.</li>
<li>The only difference is that range returns a Python list object and x range returns an xrange object. This means that xrange doesn't actually generate a static list at run-time like range does. It creates the values as you need them with a special technique called yielding. This technique is used with a type of object known as generators. That means that if you have a really gigantic range you'd like to generate a list for, say one billion, xrange is the function to use.</li>
<li>This is especially true if you have a really memory sensitive system such as a cell phone that you are working with, as range will use as much memory as it can to create your array of integers, which can result in a Memory Error and crash your program. It's a memory hungry beast.</li>

<p>If you're using classic classes: For a class definition such as&nbsp;<code>class Derived(Base):</code>&nbsp;... you can call method meth() defined in Base (or one of Base's base classes) as Base.meth(self,arguments). Here, Base.meth is an unbound method, so you need to provide the self argument.</p>

<p>You could define an alias for the base class, assign the real base class to it before your class definition, and use the alias throughout your class. Then all you have to change is the value assigned to the alias. Incidentally, this trick is also handy if you want to decide dynamically (e.g. depending on availability of resources) which base class to use.</p>

<p>You can get a pointer to the module object as follows:</p>

<p>If the module hasn't been imported yet (i.e. it is not yet present in sys.modules), this initializes the module; otherwise it simply returns the value of&nbsp;<code>sys.modules[""]</code>. Note that it doesn't enter the module into any namespace -- it only ensures it has been initialized and is stored in sys.modules. You can then access the module's attributes (i.e. any name defined in the module) as follows: attr = PyObject_GetAttrString(module, ""); Calling PyObject_SetAttrString() to assign to variables in the module also works.</p>

<p>To convert, e.g., the number 144 to the string '144', use the built-in function str(). If you want a hexadecimal or octal representation, use the built-in functions hex() or oct(). For fancy formatting, use the % operator on strings, e.g. "%04d" % 144 yields '0144' and "%.3f" % (1/3.0) yields '0.333'. See the library reference manual for details.</p>

<p>Ans. In languages like C++, we have something like this:</p>
<pre><code>switch(name)
{
    case 'Ram':
        cout&lt;&lt;"Monday";
        break;
    case 'Shiv':
        cout&lt;&lt;"Tuesday";
        break;
    default:
        cout&lt;&lt;"Hi, user";
}
</code></pre>
<p>But in Python, we do not have a switch-case statement. Here, you may write a switch function to use. Else, you may use a set of if-elif-else statements. To implement a function for this, we may use a dictionary.</p>
<pre><code>def switch(choice):     
    switcher={
        'Ram':'Monday',
        'Shiv':'Tuesday',
        print(switcher.get(choice,'Hi, user'))
    return 
    switch('Shiv')
    Tuesday
    switch('Ram')
    Monday
    switch('Raghav')
    Hi, user
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the get() method returns the value of the key. When no key matches, the default value (the second argument) is returned.</p>

Does Python support strongly for regular expressions?</h2>
<p>Yes, Python Supports Regular Expressions Well.&nbsp;<code>re</code>&nbsp;is an in-buit library for the same. There is a lot of other languages that have good support to RegEx- Perl, Awk, Sed, Java etc.</p>
<p>Regular expressions (called REs, or regexes, or regex patterns) are essentially a tiny, highly specialized programming language embedded inside Python and made available through the re module. Using this little language, you specify the rules for the set of possible strings that you want to match; this set might contain English sentences, or e-mail addresses, or TeX commands, or anything you like. You can then ask questions such as "Does this string match the pattern?", or "Is there a match for the pattern anywhere in this string?". You can also use REs to modify a string or to split it apart in various ways.</p>
<p>Regular expression patterns are compiled into a series of bytecodes which are then executed by a matching engine written in C. For advanced use, it may be necessary to pay careful attention to how the engine will execute a given RE, and write the RE in a certain way in order to produce bytecode that runs faster. Optimization isn't covered in this document, because it requires that you have a good understanding of the matching engine's internals.</p>

How do you perform pattern matching in Python? Explain.</h2>
<p>Regular Expressions/REs/ regexes enable us to specify expressions that can match specific "parts" of a given string. For instance, we can define a regular expression to match a single character or a digit, a telephone number, or an email address, etc. The Python's "re" module provides regular expression patterns and was introduce from later versions of Python 2.5. "re" module is providing methods for search text strings, or replacing text strings along with methods for splitting text strings based on the pattern defined.</p>

<p>The concept of removing unused or unreferenced objects from the memory location is known as a Garbage Collection. While executing the program, if garbage collection takes place then more memory space is available for the program and rest of the program execution becomes faster.</p>
<p>Garbage collector is a predefined program, which removes the unused or unreferenced objects from the memory location.</p>
<p>Any object reference count becomes zero then we call that object as a unused or unreferenced object Then no.of reference variables which are pointing the object is known as a reference count of the object.</p>
<p>While executing the python program if any object reference count becomes zero, then internally python interpreter calls the garbage collector and garbage collector will remove that object from memory location.</p>

<p>Python memory is managed by Python private heap space. All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap. The programmer does not have an access to this private heap and interpreter. Like other programming language python also has garbage collector which will take care of memory management in python.Python also have an inbuilt garbage collector, which recycle all the unused memory and frees the memory and makes it available to the heap space. The allocation of Python heap space for Python objects is done by Python memory manager. The core API gives access to some tools for the programmer to code.</p>
<p>Python has a private heap space to hold all objects and data structures. Being programmers, we cannot access it; it is the interpreter that manages it. But with the core API, we can access some tools. The Python memory manager controls the allocation.</p>

<p>Whenever Python exits, especially those Python modules which are having circular references to other objects or the objects that are referenced from the global namespaces are not always de-allocated or freed.It is impossible to de-allocate those portions of memory that are reserved by the C library.On exit, because of having its own efficient clean up mechanism, Python would try to de-allocate/destroy every other object.</p>

<p>In Python, every class can have instance attributes. By default Python uses a&nbsp;<code>dict</code>&nbsp;to store an object's instance attributes. This is really helpful as it allows setting arbitrary new attributes at runtime.</p>
<p>However, for small classes with known attributes it might be a bottleneck. The&nbsp;<code>dict</code>&nbsp;wastes a lot of RAM. Python can't just allocate a static amount of memory at object creation to store all the attributes. Therefore it sucks a lot of RAM if you create a lot of objects. The usage of&nbsp;<code>__slots__</code>&nbsp;to tell Python not to use a dict, and only allocate space for a fixed set of attributes.</p>

Python is Call by Value or Call by Reference? How are arguments passed by value or by reference?</h2>
<p>Everything in Python is an object and all variables hold references to the objects. The references values are according to the functions; as a result you cannot change the value of the references. However, you can change the objects if it is mutable.</p>

Explain Python's parameter-passing mechanism.</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To pass its parameters to a function, Python uses pass-by-reference. If you change a parameter within a function, the change reflects in the calling function. This is its default behavior.</p>

<p>However, when we pass literal arguments like strings, numbers, or tuples, they pass by value. This is because they are immutable.</p>

<p>A function which doesn't contain any name is known as a anonymous function lambda function, Lambda function we can assign to the variable &amp; we can call the lambda function through the variable.</p>
<p>Syntax:&nbsp;<code>Lambda arguments:expression</code></p>
<p>It is a single expression anonymous function often used as inline function. A lambda form in python does not have statements as it is used to make new function object and then return them at runtime.</p>
<p>The lambda operator is used to create anonymous functions. It is mostly used in cases where one wishes to pass functions as parameters. or assign them to variable names.</p>
<p>When we want a function with a single expression, we can define it anonymously. A lambda expression may take input and returns a value. To define the above function as a lambda expression, we type the following code in the interpreter:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-python">
<pre>(<span class="pl-k">lambda</span> <span class="pl-s1">a</span>,<span class="pl-s1">b</span>:<span class="pl-s1">a</span> <span class="pl-k">if</span> <span class="pl-s1">a</span><span class="pl-c1">&gt;</span><span class="pl-s1">b</span> <span class="pl-k">else</span> <span class="pl-s1">b</span>)(<span class="pl-c1">3</span>,<span class="pl-c1">3.5</span>)</pre>
</div>
<p><code>3.5</code></p>
<p>Here, a and b are the inputs.<br /><code>a if a &gt; b else b</code>&nbsp;is the expression to return. The arguments are 3 and 3.5.</p>
<p>It is possible to not have any inputs here.</p>
<p><code>(lambda :print("Hi"))()</code></p>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-python">
<pre><span class="pl-s1">myfunction</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-k">lambda</span> <span class="pl-s1">x</span>:<span class="pl-s1">x</span><span class="pl-c1">*</span><span class="pl-s1">x</span>     
<span class="pl-s1">a</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-en">myfunction</span>(<span class="pl-c1">10</span>)        
<span class="pl-en">print</span>(<span class="pl-s1">a</span>)</pre>
</div>
<p>Output: 100</p>
<ul>
<li>Why can't lambda forms in Python contain statements?</li>
</ul>
<p>Lambdas evaluates at run time and these do not need statements Lambda is a anonymous function, which does not have a name and no fixed number of arguments. Represented by keyword lambda followed by statement. Ex:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-python">
<pre><span class="pl-s1">add</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-k">lambda</span> <span class="pl-s1">a</span>,<span class="pl-s1">b</span>: <span class="pl-s1">a</span><span class="pl-c1">+</span><span class="pl-s1">b</span>

Explain serialization and deserialization / Pickling and unpicking.</h2>
<p>Pickle module accepts any Python object and converts it into a string representation and dumps it into a file by using dump function, this process is called pickling. While the process of retrieving original Python objects from the stored string representation is called unpickling.</p>
<p>To create portable serialized representations of Python objects, we have the module 'pickle'. It accepts a Python object (remember, everything in Python is an object). It then converts it into a string representation and uses the dump() function to dump it into a file. We call this pickling. In contrast, retrieving objects from this stored string representation is termed 'unpickling'.</p>
<p>The pickle module implements binary protocols for serializing and deserializing a Python object structure. "Pickling" is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, and "unpickling" is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream (from a binary file or bytes-like object) is converted back into an object hierarchy. Pickling (and unpickling) is alternatively known as&nbsp;<code>serialization</code>,&nbsp;<code>marshalling</code>, or&nbsp;<code>flattening</code>; however, to avoid confusion, the terms used here are&nbsp;<code>pickling</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>unpickling</code>.</p>

How do I copy a file? How to copy object in Python? Diff between shallow copy and deep copy?</h2>
<p>The shutil module contains a&nbsp;<code>copyfile()</code>&nbsp;function.</p>
<p>A deep copy copies an object into another. This means that if you make a change to a copy of an object, it won't affect the original object. In Python, we use the function deepcopy() for this, and we import the module copy. We use it like:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-python">
<pre><span class="pl-k">import</span> <span class="pl-s1">copy</span>
<span class="pl-s1">b</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">copy</span>.<span class="pl-en">deepcopy</span> (<span class="pl-s1">a</span>)</pre>
</div>
<p>A shallow copy, however, copies one object's reference to another. So, if we make a change in the copy, it will affect the original object. For this, we have the function&nbsp;<code>copy()</code>, we use it like:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-python">
<pre><span class="pl-s1">b</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">copy</span>.<span class="pl-en">copy</span>(<span class="pl-s1">a</span>)</pre>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Differentiate between lists and tuples.</li>
</ul>
<p>The major difference is that a list is mutable, but a tuple is immutable. Examples:</p>

What is the purpose of PYTHONSTARTUP, PYTHONCASEOK, PYTHONHOME &amp; PYTHONPATH environment variables?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>PYTHONSTARTUP &minus; It contains the path of an initialization file containing Python source code. It is executed every time you start the interpreter. It is named as .pythonrc.py in Unix and it contains commands that load utilities or modify PYTHONPATH.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PYTHONCASEOK &minus; It is used in Windows to instruct Python to find the first case-insensitive match in an import statement. Set this variable to any value to activate it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PYTHONHOME &minus; It is an alternative module search path. It is usually embedded in the PYTHONSTARTUP or PYTHONPATH directories to make switching module libraries easy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PYTHONPATH &minus; It has a role similar to PATH. This variable tells the Python interpreter where to locate the module files imported into a program. It should include the Python source library directory and the directories containing Python source code. PYTHONPATH is sometimes preset by the Python installer.</p>

Explain Inheritance in Python with an example.</h2>
<p>When one class inherits from another, it is said to be the child/ derived/sub class inheriting from the parent/base/super class. It inherits/gains all members (attributes and methods). Inheritance lets us reuse our code, and also makes it easier to create and maintain applications.</p>
<p>Inheritance allows One class to gain all the members(say attributes and methods) of another class. Inheritance provides code reusability,makes it easier to create and maintain an application. The class from which we are inheriting is called super-class and the class that is inherited is called a derived/child class.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They are different types of inheritance supported by Python:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Single Inheritance &ndash; where a derived class acquires the members of a single super class.</p>
<p><em>OR</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Single Inheritance- A class inherits from a single base class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multi-level inheritance &ndash; a derived class d1 in inherited from base class base1, and d2 is inherited from base2.</p>
<p><em>OR</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multilevel Inheritance- A class inherits from a base class, which in turn, inherits from another base class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hierarchical inheritance &ndash; from one base class you can inherit any number of child classes</p>
<p><em>OR</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hierarchical Inheritance- Multiple classes inherit from a single base class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple inheritance &ndash; a derived class is inherited from more than one base class.</p>
<p><em>OR</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple Inheritance- A class inherits from multiple base classes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hybrid Inheritance- Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance.</p>

Suppose class C inherits from classes A and B as class C(A,B).Classes A and B both have their own versions of method func(). If we call func() from an object of class C, which version gets invoked?</h2>
<p>Ans. In our article on Multiple Inheritance in Python, we discussed Method Resolution Order (MRO). C does not contain its own version of func(). Since the interpreter searches in a left-to-right fashion, it finds the method in A, and does not go to look for it in B.</p>

Which methods/functions do we use to determine the type of instance and inheritance?</h2>
<p>Ans. Here, we talk about three methods/functions-&nbsp;<code>type(), isinstance() and issubclass()</code>.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;<code>type()</code>: This tells us the type of object we're working with.</p>
<pre><code>type(3)

<p>&lt;class 'int'&gt;</p>
<pre><code>type(False)
</code></pre>
<p>&lt;class 'bool'&gt;</p>

</code></pre>
<p>&lt;class 'function'&gt;</p>
<pre><code>type(type)
</code></pre>
<p>&lt;class 'type'&gt;</p>
<p>b. isinstance()</p>
<p>This takes in two arguments- a value and a type. If the value is of the kind of the specified type, it returns True. Else, it returns False.</p>
<pre><code> isinstance(3,int)

<p>True</p>
<pre><code> isinstance((1),tuple)

<p>False</p>
<pre><code> isinstance((1,),tuple)

<p>True</p>
<p>c. issubclass()</p>
<p>This takes two classes as arguments. If the first one inherits from the second, it returns True. Else, it returns False.</p>
<pre><code> class A: pass
 class B(A): pass

What are negative indexes and why are they used?</h2>
<p>Python sequences can be index in positive and negative numbers. For positive index, 0 is the first index, 1 is the second index and so forth. For negative index, (-1) is the last index and (-2) is the second last index and so forth.</p>
<p>The sequences in Python are indexed and it consists of the positive as well as negative numbers. The numbers that are positive uses '0' that is uses as first index and '1' as the second index and the process goes on like that.</p>
<p>The index for the negative number starts from '-1' that represents the last index in the sequence and '-2' as the penultimate index and the sequence carries forward like the positive number.</p>
<p>The negative index is used to remove any new-line spaces from the string and allow the string to except the last character that is given as S[:-1]. The negative index is also used to show the index to represent the string in correct order.</p>
<p>Let's take a list for this.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-python">
<pre><span class="pl-s1">mylist</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span>[<span class="pl-c1">0</span>,<span class="pl-c1">1</span>,<span class="pl-c1">2</span>,<span class="pl-c1">3</span>,<span class="pl-c1">4</span>,<span class="pl-c1">5</span>,<span class="pl-c1">6</span>,<span class="pl-c1">7</span>,<span class="pl-c1">8</span>]</pre>

<p>A negative index, unlike a positive one, begins searching from the right.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, NumPy would contain nothing but the array data type and the most basic operations: indexing, sorting, reshaping, basic element wise functions, et cetera. All numerical code would reside in SciPy. However, one of NumPy's important goals is compatibility, so NumPy tries to retain all features supported by either of its predecessors. Thus NumPy contains some linear algebra functions, even though these more properly belong in SciPy. In any case, SciPy contains more fully-featured versions of the linear algebra modules, as well as many other numerical algorithms. If you are doing scientific computing with python, you should probably install both NumPy and SciPy. Most new features belong in SciPy rather than NumPy.</p>

<p>Yes. Python is Object Oriented Programming language. OOP is the programming paradigm based on classes and instances of those classes called objects. The features of OOP are: Encapsulation, Data Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism.</p>

Does Python supports interfaces like in Java? Discuss.</h2>
<p>Python does not provide interfaces like in Java. Abstract Base Class (ABC) and its feature are provided by the Python's "abc" module. Abstract Base Class is a mechanism for specifying what methods must be implemented by its implementation subclasses. The use of ABC'c provides a sort of "understanding" about methods and their expected behaviour. This module was made available from Python 2.7 version onwards.</p>

<p>Accessors and mutators are often called getters and setters in languages like "Java". For example, if x is a property of a user-defined class, then the class would have methods called setX() and getX(). Python has an @property 'decorator' that allows you to ad getters and setters in order to access the attribute of the class.</p>

Differentiate between append() and extend() methods.?</h2>
<p>Both append() and extend() methods are the methods of list. These methods are used to add the elements at the end of the list.</p>
<p><code>append(element)</code>&nbsp;&ndash; adds the given element at the end of the list which has called this method.<br /><code>extend(another-list)</code>&nbsp;&ndash; adds the elements of another-list at the end of the list which is called the extend method.</p>

Name few methods that are used to implement Functionally Oriented Programming in Python?</h2>
<p>Python supports methods (called iterators in Python3), such as filter(), map(), and reduce(), that are very useful when you need to iterate over the items in a list, create a dictionary, or extract a subset of a list.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>filter()</code>&nbsp;&ndash; enables you to extract a subset of values based on conditional logic.</li>
<li><code>map()</code>&nbsp;&ndash; it is a built-in function that applies the function to each item in an iterable.</li>
<li><code>reduce()</code>&nbsp;&ndash; repeatedly performs a pair-wise reduction on a sequence until a single value is computed.</li>
</ul>

<p>It means running several different programs at the same time concurrently by invoking multiple threads. Multiple threads within a process refer the data space with main thread and they can communicate with each other to share information more easily.Threads are light-weight processes and have less memory overhead. Threads can be used just for quick task like calculating results and also running other processes in the background while the main program is running.</p>
<p>Thread Is a functionality or logic which can execute simultaneously along with the other part of the program. Thread is a light weight process. Any program which is under execution is known as process. We can define the threads in python by overwriting run method of thread class.<br />Thread class is a predefined class which is defined in threading module.<br />Thread in module is a predefined module.<br />If we call the run method directly the logic of the run method will be executed as a normal method logic. In order to execute the logic of the run method as a we use start method of thread class. Example</p>

<p>A thread is a lightweight process and multithreading allows us to execute multiple threads at once. As you know, Python is a multithreaded language. It has a multithreading package. The GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) ensures that a single thread executes at a time. A thread holds the GIL and does a little work before passing it on to the next thread. This makes for an illusion of parallel execution. But in reality, it is just threaded taking turns at the CPU. Of course, all the passing around adds overhead to the execution.</p>

<p>A language is case-sensitive if it distinguishes between identifiers like myname and Myname. In other words, it cares about <a href="https://textfancy.com/case-converter/" rel="nofollow">case- lowercase or</a> uppercase. Let's try this with Python.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-python">
<pre><span class="pl-s1">myname</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">'Ramayan'</span>

</div>
<p>Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;pyshell#3&gt;", line 1, in Myname NameError: name 'Myname' is not defined</p>
<p>As you can see, this raised a NameError. This means that Python is indeed case-sensitive.</p>
<ul>
<li>How long can an identifier be in Python?</li>
</ul>
<p>In Python, an identifier can be of any length. Apart from that, there are certain rules we must follow to name one:</p>
<pre><code>- It can only begin with an underscore or a character from A-Z or a-z.
- The rest of it can contain anything from the following: A-Z/a-z/_/0-9.
- Python is case-sensitive, as we discussed in the previous question.
- Keywords cannot be used as identifiers.
</code></pre>
<p>Python has the following keywords:<br /><code>and def False import not True</code><br /><code>as del finally in or try</code><br /><code>assert elif for is pass while</code><br /><code>break else from lambda print with</code><br /><code>class except global None raise yield</code><br /><code>continue exec if nonlocal return</code></p>

How do you remove the leading whitespace in a string?</h2>
<p>Leading whitespace in a string is the whitespace in a string before the first non-whitespace character. To remove it from a string, we use the method&nbsp;<code>lstrip()</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-python">
<pre><span class="pl-s">'   Ram '</span>.<span class="pl-en">lstrip</span>()</pre>
</div>
<p>'Ram '</p>
<p>As you can see, this string had both leading and trailing whitespaces. lstrip() stripped the string of the leading whitespace. If we want to strip the trailing whitespace instead, we use rstrip().</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-python">
<pre><span class="pl-s">'   Ram '</span>.<span class="pl-en">rstrip</span>()</pre>
</div>
<p>' Ram'</p>
<ul>
<li>How would you convert a string into lowercase?</li>
</ul>
<p>We use the lower() method for this.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-python">
<pre><span class="pl-s">'Ramayan'</span>.<span class="pl-en">lower</span>()</pre>
</div>
<p>'ramayan'</p>
<p>To convert it into uppercase, then, we use upper().</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-python">
<pre><span class="pl-s">'Ramayan'</span>.<span class="pl-en">upper</span>()</pre>
</div>
<p>'RAMAYAN'</p>
<p>Also, to check if a string is in all uppercase or all lowercase, we use the methods isupper() and islower().</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-python">
<pre><span class="pl-s">'Ramayan'</span>.<span class="pl-en">isupper</span>()</pre>
</div>
<p>False</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-python">
<pre><span class="pl-s">'Ramayan'</span>.<span class="pl-en">isupper</span>()</pre>
</div>
<p>True</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-python">
<pre><span class="pl-s">'Ramayan'</span>.<span class="pl-en">islower</span>()</pre>

<p>True</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-python">

<p>A docstring is a documentation string that we use to explain what a construct does. We place it as the first thing under a function, class, or a method, to describe what it does. We declare a docstring using three sets of single or double quotes.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-python">

<span class="pl-en">sayhi</span>()</pre>
</div>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>To get a function's docstring, we use its&nbsp;<code>__doc__</code>&nbsp;attribute.</p>

<p>For taking input from user, we have the function input(). In Python 2, we had another function raw_input().</p>
<p>The input() function takes, as an argument, the text to be displayed for the task:</p>
<pre><code> a=input('Enter a number')
</code></pre>
<p>Enter a number7</p>
<p>But if you have paid attention, you know that it takes input in the form of a string.</p>
<pre><code> type(a)

<p>We use the int() function for this.</p>
<pre><code> a=int(input('Enter a number'))

<p>Answer these type of Python Interview Questions with Examples.</p>
<p>First, let's discuss what a set is. A set is a collection of items, where there cannot be any duplicates. A set is also unordered.</p>
<pre><code> myset={1,3,2,2}
 myset
</code></pre>
<p><code>{1, 2, 3}</code></p>

 list1,list2,list3

<p>Ans. ([10, 'a'], [123], [10, 'a'])</p>
<p>You'd expect the output to be something like this:</p>
<p>([10],[123],['a'])</p>
<p>Well, this is because the list argument does not initialize to its default value ([]) every time we make a call to the function. Once we define the function, it creates a new list. Then, whenever we call it again without a list argument, it uses the same list. This is because it calculates the expressions in the default arguments when we define the function, not when we call it.</p>

<p>A decorator is essentially a callable Python object that is used to modify or extend a function or class definition.</p>
<p>One of the beauties of decorators is that a single decorator definition can be applied to multiple functions (or classes). Much can thereby be accomplished with decorators that would otherwise require lots of boilerplate (or even worse redundant!) code.</p>
<p>Flask, for example, uses decorators as the mechanism for adding new endpoints to a web application. Examples of some of the more common uses of decorators include adding synchronization, type enforcement,logging, or pre/post conditions to a class or function.</p>

Explain the use of the 'nonlocal' keyword in Python.</h2>
<p>Ans. First, let's discuss the local and global scope. By example, a variable defined inside a function is local to that function. Another variable defined outside any other scope is global to the function.</p>
<p>Suppose we have nested functions. We can read a variable in an enclosing scope from inside he inner function, but cannot make a change to it. For that, we must declare it nonlocal inside the function. First, let's see this without the nonlocal keyword.</p>
<pre><code> def outer():
    a=7
    def inner():
        print(a)
    inner()
 outer()
</code></pre>
<p>7</p>
<pre><code> def outer():
    a=7
    def inner():
        print(a)
        a+=1
        print(a)
    inner()

 outer()
</code></pre>
<p>Traceback (most recent call last):<br />File "&lt;pyshell#462&gt;", line 1, in outer() File "&lt;pyshell#461&gt;", line 7, in outer inner() File "&lt;pyshell#461&gt;", line 4, in inner print(a) UnboundLocalError: local variable 'a' referenced before assignment</p>
<p>So now, let's try doing this with the 'nonlocal' keyword:</p>
<pre><code> def outer():
    a=7
    def inner():
        nonlocal a
        print(a)
        a+=1
        print(a)
</code></pre>
<p>inner()</p>

<p>Ans. What we call getters and setters in languages like Java, we term accessors and mutators in Python. In Java, if we have a user-defined class with a property 'x', we have methods like getX() and setX(). In Python, we have @property, which is syntactic sugar for property(). This lets us get and set variables without compromising on the conventions. For a detailed explanation on property, refer to Python property.</p>

Differentiate between the append() and extend() methods of a list.</h2>
<p>Ans. The methods append() and extend() work on lists. While append()adds an element to the end of the list, extend adds another list to the end of a list.</p>
<p>Let's take two lists.</p>
<pre><code>list1,list2=[1,2,3],[5,6,7,8]
</code></pre>
<p>This is how append() works:</p>
<pre><code>list1.append(4)
list1
</code></pre>
<p>[1, 2, 3, 4]</p>
<p>And this is how extend() works:</p>
<pre><code>list1.extend(list2)
list1
</code></pre>
<p>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]</p>

<p>Ans. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a highly popular data format, and it stores data into NoSQL databases. JSON is generally built on the following two structures:</p>
<pre><code>A collection of &lt;name,value&gt; pairs
An ordered list of values.
</code></pre>
<p>Python supports JSON parsers. In fact, JSON-based data is internally represented as a dictionary in Python. To convert JSON data into Python data, we use the load() function from the JSON module.</p>

<p>Try, except and finally blocks are used in Python error handling. Code is executed in the try block until an error occurs. One can use a generic except block, which will receive control after all errors, or one can use specific exception handling blocks for various error types. Control is transferred to the appropriate except block. In all cases, the finally block is executed. Raise may be used to raise your own exceptions.</p>

<p>In Python, every name introduced has a place where it lives and can be hooked for. This is known as namespace. It is like a box where a variable name is mapped to the object placed. Whenever the variable is searched out, this box will be searched, to get corresponding object.</p>
<p>A namespace is a collection of names. It maps names to corresponding objects. When different namespaces contain objects with the same names, this avoids any name collisions. Internally, a namespace is implemented as a Python dictionary.</p>
<p>On starting the interpreter, it creates a namespace for as long as we don't exit. We have local namespaces, global namespaces, and a built-in namespace.</p>

How does the Python version numbering scheme work?</h2>
<p>Python versions are numbered A.B.C or A.B.</p>
<p>A is the major version number. It is only incremented for major changes in the language.</p>
<p>B is the minor version number, incremented for less earth-shattering changes.</p>
<p>C is the micro-level. It is incremented for each bug fix release. Not all releases are bug fix releases.</p>
<p>In the run-up to a new major release, 'A' series of development releases are made denoted as alpha, beta, or release candidate.</p>
<p>Alphas are early releases in which interfaces aren't finalized yet; it's not unexpected to see an interface change between two alpha releases.</p>
<p>Betas are more stable, preserving existing interfaces but possibly adding new modules, and release candidates are frozen, making no changes except as needed to fix critical bugs.</p>
<p>Alpha, beta and release candidate versions have an additional suffix.</p>
<p>The suffix for an alpha version is "aN" for some small number N,</p>
<p>The suffix for a beta version is "bN" for some small number N,</p>
<p>And the suffix for a release candidate version is "cN" for some small number N.</p>
<p>In other words, all versions labeled 2.0aN precede the versions labeled 2.0bN, which precede versions labeled 2.0cN, and those precede 2.0.</p>
<p>You may also find version numbers with a "+" suffix, e.g. "2.2+". These are unreleased versions, built directly from the subversion trunk. In practice, after a final minor release is made, the subversion trunk is incremented to the next minor version, which becomes the "a0" version, e.g. "2.4a0".</p>

Where is math.py (socket.py, regex.py, etc.) source file?</h2>
<p>If you can't find a source file for a module, it may be a built-in or dynamically loaded module implemented in C, C++ or other compiled language. In this case you may not have the source file or it may be something like mathmodule.c, somewhere in a C source directory (not on the Python Path). There are (at least) three kinds of modules in Python:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modules written in Python (.py);</li>
<li>Modules written in C and dynamically loaded (.dll, .pyd, .so, .sl, etc);</li>
<li>Modules written in C and linked with the interpreter; to get a list of these, type; Import sys print sys.builtin_module_names;</li>

How do I make a Python script executable on UNIX?</h2>
<p>You need to do two things: The script file's mode must be executable and the first line must begin with "#!" followed by the path of the Python interpreter.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first is done by executing chmod +x scriptfile or perhaps chmod 755 'script' file.</li>
<li>The second can be done in a number of ways.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most straightforward way is to write:<br /><code>#!/usr/local/bin/python</code></p>
<p>as the very first line of your file, using the pathname for where the Python interpreter is installed on your platform. If you would like the script to be independent of where the Python interpreter lives, you can use the "env" program. Almost all UNIX variants support the following, assuming the python interpreter is in a directory on the users $PATH:</p>
<p><code>#! /usr/bin/env python</code></p>
<p>Don't do this for CGI scripts. The&nbsp;<strong>$PATH</strong>&nbsp;variable for CGI scripts is often minimal, so you need to use the actual absolute pathname of the interpreter. Occasionally, a user's environment is so full that the /usr/bin/env program fails; or there's no env program at all. In that case, you can try the following hack (due to Alex Rezinsky):</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-python">
<pre><span class="pl-c">#! /bin/sh</span>
<span class="pl-s">""":"</span>
<span class="pl-s">exec python $0 ${1+"$@"}</span>
<span class="pl-s">"""</span></pre>
</div>
<p>The minor disadvantage is that this defines the script's&nbsp;<code>__doc__</code>string. However, you can fix that by adding:<br /><code>__doc__ = """&hellip;Whatever&hellip;"""</code></p>

Why is that none of my threads are not running? How can I make it work?</h2>
<p>As soon as the main thread exits, all threads are killed. Your main thread is running too quickly, giving the threads no time to do any work. A simple fix is to add a sleep to the end of the program that's long enough for all the threads to finish:</p>

What Are The Implementation In Python Program?</h2>
<p>Python program can be implemented by two ways</p>
<pre><code>1. Interactive Mode (Submit statement by statement explicitly)
2. Batch Mode (Writing all statements and submit all statements)
</code></pre>
<p>In Interactive mode python command shell is required. It is available in installation of python cell.</p>
<p>In Interactive mode is not suitable for developing the projects &amp; Applications</p>
<p>Interactive mode is used for predefined function and programs. Example:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-python">
<pre><span class="pl-v">X</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-c1">1000</span>
<span class="pl-v">Y</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-c1">2000</span>
<span class="pl-v">X</span><span class="pl-c1">+</span><span class="pl-v">Y</span>
<span class="pl-c1">3000</span>
<span class="pl-v">Quit</span>(<span class="pl-v">X</span><span class="pl-c1">+</span><span class="pl-v">Y</span>)</pre>
</div>
<p>X, Y is not find. Interactive mode is unfit for looping purpose.</p>
<p>Interactive Mode: The concept of submitting one by one python statements explicitly in the python interpreter is known as "Interactive Mode" In Order to submit the one by one python statements explicitly to the python interpreter we use python command line shell. Python command line shell is present in python software We can open the python command line shell by executing python command on command prompt or terminal Example: c:/users/mindmajix&gt;python<br /><code>3+4</code><br />7</p>
<p><code>'mindmajix'*3</code><br />'mindmajix mindmajix mindmajix'</p>
<p><code>x=1000</code><br /><code>y=2000</code><br /><code>x+y</code><br />3000<br />Quit<br />x+y<br />c:/users/sailu&gt;python Error: name 'X' not defined</p>
<p>Batch Mode:<br />In the concept of writing the group of python statements in a file, save the file with extension .py and submit that entire file to the python interpreter is known as Batch Mode.</p>
<p>In Order to develop the python files we use editors or IDE's Different editors are notepad, notepad++, edit+,nano, VI, gedil and so on.<br />Open the notepad and write the following code:</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-python">
<pre><span class="pl-v">X</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-c1">1000</span>
<span class="pl-v">Y</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-c1">2000</span>
<span class="pl-en">print</span>(<span class="pl-s1">x</span><span class="pl-c1">+</span><span class="pl-s1">y</span>, <span class="pl-s1">x</span><span class="pl-c1">-</span><span class="pl-s1">y</span>, <span class="pl-s1">x</span><span class="pl-c1">*</span><span class="pl-s1">y</span>)</pre>
</div>
<p>Save the file in D drive mindmajix python folder with the demo.py Open command prompt and execute following commands:</p>
<p>Python D:/mindmajix python/Demo.py</p>
<p>3000</p>
<p>-1000</p>
<p>2000.000</p>
<p>Save another method if we correctly set the path</p>
<p>D:</p>
<p>D:/&gt;cd "mindmajix python"</p>
<p>D:/mindmajix Python&gt;python Demo.py<br /><code>3000</code><br /><code>-1000</code><br /><code>2000.000</code></p>

What are The Data Types Supports in Python Language?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Numbers- Numbers use to hold numerical values.</li>
<li>Strings- A string is a sequence of characters. We declare it using single or double quotes.</li>
<li>Lists- A list is an ordered collection of values, and we declare it using square brackets.</li>
<li>Tuples- A tuple, like a list, is an ordered collection of values. The difference. However, is that a tupleis immutable. This means that we cannot change a value in it.</li>
<li>Dictionary- A dictionary is a data structure that holds key-value pairs. We declare it using curly braces.</li>
<li>We can also use a dictionary comprehension:</li>
</ul>
<p>Numbers: Int Float Complex Boolean Operational: Strings List Tuple Set Dictionary</p>
<p>Every data type in python language is internally implemented as a class. Python language data types are categorized into two types.</p>
<p>They are:</p>

<li>Current directory (main module location)</li>
<li>Environment variable path</li>
<li>Installation dependent directory</li>
<li>If the imported module is not found in the any one of the above locations. Then python interpreter giveserror.</li>
<li>Built-in attributes of a module:</li>
<li>By default for each and every python module some properties are added internally and we call thoseproperties as a built-in-attribute of a module</li>

<p>File is a named location on the disk, which stores the data in permanent manner. Python language provides various functions and methods to provide the communication between python programs and files. Python programs can open the file, perform the read or write operations on the file and close the file We can open the files by calling open function of built-in-modules At the time of opening the file, we have to specify the mode of the file Mode of the file indicates for what purpose the file is going to be opened(r,w,a,b)</p>

Executing DML Commands Through Python Programs?</h2>
<p>DML (Data Modification Language) Commands are used to modify the data of the database objects Whenever we execute DML Commands the records are going to be modified temporarily.</p>
<p>Whenever we run "rollback" command the modified records will come back to its original state.</p>
<p>To modify the records of the database objects permanently we use "commit" command</p>
<p>After executing the commit command even though we execute "rollback" command, the modified records will not come back to its original state.</p>
<p>Create the emp1 table in the database by using following command<br /><code>Create table emp1 as select * from emp;</code></p>
<p>Whenever we run the DML commands through the python program, then the no.of records which are modified because of that command will be stored into the rowcount attribute of cursor object.<br />After executing the DML Command through the python program we have to call commit method of cursor object.</p>

<p>The way of implementing iterators are known as generators. It is a normal function except that it yields expression in the function.<br />Python generator produces a sequence of values to iterate on. This way, it is kind of an iterable. We define a function that 'yields' values one by one, and then use a for loop to iterate on it.</p>
<pre><code>    def squares(n):
        i=1
        while(i&lt;=n):
            yield i**2
            i+=1
    for i in squares(7):

<p>An iterator returns one object at a time to iterate on. To create an iterator, we use the iter() function.</p>
<pre><code>odds=iter([1,3,5])
</code></pre>
<p>Then, we call the next() function on it every time we want an object.</p>
<pre><code> next(odds)
</code></pre>
<p>1</p>
<pre><code> next(odds)
</code></pre>
<p>3</p>
<pre><code> next(odds)
</code></pre>
<p>5</p>
<p>And now, when we call it again, it raises a StopIteration exception. This is because it has reached the end of the values to iterate on.</p>
<pre><code> next(odds)

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "&lt;pyshell#295&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; next(odds)

Explain generators and iterators in python?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They do, but there are subtle differences:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a generator, we create a function. For an iterator, we use in-built functions&nbsp;<code>iter()</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>next()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a generator, we use the keyword 'yield' to yield/return an object at a time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A generator may have as many 'yield' statements as you want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A generator will save the states of the local variables every time 'yield' will pause the loop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An iterator does not use local variables; it only needs an iterable to iterate on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using a class, you can implement your own iterator, but not a generator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generators are fast, compact, and simpler.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iterators are more memory-efficient.</p>

Explain what is Dogpile effect? How can you prevent this effect?</h2>
<p>Dogpile effect is referred to the event when cache expires, and websites are hit by the multiple requests made by the client at the same time.<br />This effect can be prevented by using semaphore lock. In this system when value expires, first process acquires the lock and starts generating new value.</p>

<p>Memcached common misuse is to use it as a data store, and not as a cache. Never use Memcached as the only source of the information you need to run your application. Data should always be available through another source as well. Memcached is just a key or value store and cannot perform query over the data or iterate over the contents to extract information.</p>
<p>Memcached does not offer any form of security either in encryption or authentication</p>

What is List Comprehensions feature of Python used for?</h2>
<p>List comprehensions help to create and manage lists in a simpler and clearer way than using&nbsp;<code>map()</code>,&nbsp;<code>filter()</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>lambda</code>. Each list comprehension consists of an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses.</p>

What are lambda expressions, list comprehensions and generator expressions?</h2>
<p><strong>Lambda expressions</strong></p>
<p>are a shorthand technique for creating single line, anonymous functions. Their simple, inline nature often &ndash; though not always &ndash; leads to more readable and concise code than the alternative of formal function declarations. On the other hand, their terse inline nature, by definition, very much limits what they are capable of doing and their applicability. Being anonymous and inline, the only way to use the same lambda function in multiple locations in your code is to specify it redundantly.</p>
<p><strong>List comprehensions</strong></p>
<p>provide a concise syntax for creating lists. List comprehensions are commonly used to make lists where each element is the result of some operation(s) applied to each member of another sequence or iterable. They can also be used to create a subsequence of those elements whose members satisfy a certain condition. In Python, list comprehensions provide an alternative to using the built-in map() and filter() functions.</p>
<p>As the applied usage of lambda expressions and list comprehensions can overlap, opinions vary widely as to when and where to use one vs. the other. One point to bear in mind, though, is that a list comprehension executes somewhat faster than a comparable solution using map and lambda (some quick tests yielded a performance difference of roughly 10%). This is because calling a lambda function creates a new stack frame while the expression in the list comprehension is evaluated without doing so.</p>
<p><strong>Generator expressions</strong></p>
<p>are syntactically and functionally similar to list comprehensions but there are some fairly significant differences between the ways the two operate and, accordingly, when each should be used. In a nutshell, iterating over a generator expression or list comprehension will essentially do the same thing, but the list comprehension will create the entire list in memory first while the generator expression will create the items on the fly as needed. Generator expressions can therefore be used for very large (and even infinite) sequences and their lazy (i.e., on demand) generation of values results in improved performance and lower memory usage. It is worth noting, though, that the standard Python list methods can be used on the result of a list comprehension, but not directly on that of a generator expression.</p>

<p>append() # calling with no arg uses default list value of [][0]</p>
<p>append() # but what happens when we AGAIN call append with no arg?</p>
<p><strong>Ans:</strong></p>
<p>When the default value for a function argument is an expression, the expression is evaluated only once, not every time the function is called. Thus, once the list argument has been initialized to an empty array, subsequent calls to append without any argument specified will continue to use the same array to which list was originally initialized. This will therefore yield the following, presumably unexpected, behavior:</p>
<p>append() # first call with no arg uses default list value of [][0] append() # but then look what happens...[0, 1] append() # successive calls keep extending the same default list! [0, 1, 2] append() # and so on, and so on, and so on... [0, 1, 2, 3]</p>

<p>But in Python, makes it possible to do the swap with a single line of code (thanks to implicit tuple packing and unpacking) as follows:</p>

<p>As noted in Why Are There So Many Pythons?, this is, frankly, a bit of a trick question in that it is malformed. Python itself is nothing more than an interface definition (as is true with any language specification) of which there are multiple implementations. Accordingly, the question of whether "Python" is interpreted or compiled does not apply to the Python language itself; rather, it applies to each specific implementation of the Python specification.</p>
<p>Further complicating the answer to this question is the fact that, in the case of CPython (the most common Python implementation), the answer really is "sort of both". Specifically, with CPython, code is first compiled and then interpreted. More precisely, it is not precompiled to native machine code, but rather to bytecode. While machine code is certainly faster, bytecode is more portable and secure. The bytecode is then interpreted in the case of CPython (or both interpreted and compiled to optimized machine code at runtime in the case of PyPy).</p>

What are some alternative implementations to CPython? When and why might you use them?</h2>
<p>One of the more prominent alternative implementations is Jython, a Python implementation written in Java that utilizes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). While CPython produces bytecode to run on the CPython VM, Jython produces Java bytecode to run on the JVM.</p>
<p>Another is IronPython, written in C# and targeting the .NET stack. IronPython runs on Microsoft's Common Language Runtime (CLR).</p>
<p>As also pointed out in Why Are There So Many Pythons?, it is entirely possible to survive without ever touching a non-CPython implementation of Python, but there are advantages to be had from switching, most of which are dependent on your technology stack.</p>
<p>Another noteworthy alternative implementation is PyPy whose key features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed. Thanks to its Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler, Python programs often run faster on PyPy.</li>
<li>Memory usage. Large, memory-hungry Python programs might end up taking less space with PyPy than they do in CPython.</li>
<li>Compatibility. PyPy is highly compatible with existing python code. It supports cffi and can run popular Python libraries like Twisted and Django.</li>
<li>Sandboxing. PyPy provides the ability to run untrusted code in a fully secure way.</li>
<li>Stackless mode. PyPy comes by default with support for stackless mode, providing micro-threads for massive concurrency.</li>

What is unittest in Python? What's your approach to unit testing in Python?</h2>
<p>A unit testing framework in Python is known as unittest. It supports sharing of setups, automation testing, shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into collections etc.</p>
<p>The most fundamental answer to this question centers around Python's unittest testing framework. Basically, if a candidate doesn't mention unittest when answering this question, that should be a huge red flag.</p>
<p><code>unittest</code>&nbsp;supports test automation, sharing of setup and shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into collections, and independence of the tests from the reporting framework. The unittest module provides classes that make it easy to support these qualities for a set of tests.</p>
<p>Assuming that the candidate does mention unittest (if they don't, you may just want to end the interview right then and there!), you should also ask them to describe the key elements of the unittest framework; namely, test fixtures, test cases, test suites and test runners.</p>
<p>A more recent addition to the unittest framework is mock. mock allows you to replace parts of your system under test with mock objects and make assertions about how they are to be used. mock is now part of the Python standard library, available as unittest.mock in Python 3.3 onwards.</p>
<p>The value and power of mock are well explained in An Introduction to Mocking in Python. As noted therein, system calls are prime candidates for mocking: whether writing a script to eject a CD drive, a web server which removes antiquated cache files from /tmp, or a socket server which binds to a TCP port, these calls all feature undesired side-effects in the context of unit tests. Similarly, keeping your unit-tests efficient and performant means keeping as much "slow code" as possible out of the automated test runs, namely filesystem and network access.</p>

How do I test a Python program or component?</h2>
<p>Python comes with two testing frameworks: The documentation test module finds examples in the documentation strings for a module and runs them, comparing the output with the expected output given in the documentation string.</p>
<p>The unittest moduleis a fancier testing framework modeled on Java and Smalltalk testing frameworks.</p>
<p>For testing, it helps to write the program so that it may be easily tested by using good modular design. Your program should have almost all functionality encapsulated in either functions or class methods. And this sometimes has the surprising and delightful effect of making the program run faster because local variable accesses are faster than global accesses.</p>
<p>Furthermore the program should avoid depending on mutating global variables, since this makes testing much more difficult to do. The "global main logic" of your program may be as simple as:</p>
<p>if&nbsp;<strong>name</strong>=="<strong>main</strong>":<br />main_logic()</p>
<p>at the bottom of the main module of your program. Once your program is organized as a tractable collection of functions and class behaviors, you should write test functions that exercise the behaviors.</p>
<p>A test suite can be associated with each module which automates a sequence of tests.</p>
<p>You can make coding much more pleasant by writing your test functions in parallel with the "production code", since this makes it easy to find bugs and even design flaws earlier.</p>
<p>"Support modules" that are not intended to be the main module of a program may include a self-test of the module.</p>
<p>if&nbsp;<strong>name</strong>&nbsp;== "<strong>main</strong>": self_test()</p>
<p>Even programs that interact with complex external interfaces may be tested when the external interfaces are unavailable by using "fake" interfaces implemented in Python.</p>

<p>Python Flask, as we've previously discussed, is a web microframework for Python. It is based on the '<code>Werkzeug</code>,&nbsp;<code>Jinja 2</code>&nbsp;and good intentions' BSD license. Two of its dependencies are Werkzeug and Jinja2. This means that it has around no dependencies on external libraries. Due to this, we can call it a light framework. A session uses a signed cookie to allow the user to look at and modify session contents. It will remember information from one request to another. However, to modify a session, the user must have the secret key&nbsp;<code>Flask.secret_key</code>.</p>
<p>Flask is a web micro framework for Python based on "Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions" BSD licensed. Werkzeug and jingja are two of its dependencies.</p>
<p>Flask is part of the micro-framework. Which means it will have little to no dependencies on external libraries. It makes the framework light while there is little dependency to update and less security bugs.</p>

Explain how you can access sessions in Flask?</h2>
<p>A session basically allows you to remember information from one request to another. In a flask, it uses a signed cookie so the user can look at the session contents and modify. The user can modify the session if only it has the secret key Flask.secret_key.</p>

Is Flask an MVC model and if yes give an example showing MVC pattern for your application?</h2>
<p>Basically, Flask is a minimalistic framework which behaves same as MVC framework. So MVC is a perfect fit for Flask, and the pattern for MVC we will consider for the following example</p>
<p>from flask import Flask app = Flask(<em>name</em>) @app.route("/") def hello(): return "Hello World" app.run(debug = True)</p>
<p>In this code your,</p>
<p>Configuration part will be</p>
<pre><code>from flask import Flask
app = Flask(_name_)
</code></pre>
<p>View part will be</p>
<pre><code>@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello World"
</code></pre>
<p>While your model or main part will be</p>
<pre><code>app.run(debug = True)
</code></pre>

Explain database connection in Python Flask?</h2>
<p>Best database for flask is MySQL. Flask supports database powered application (RDBS). Such system requires creating a schema, which requires piping the shema.sql file into a sqlite3 command. So you need to install&nbsp;<code>sqlite3</code>&nbsp;command in order to create or initiate the database in Flask. Flask allows to request database in three ways</p>
<ul>
<li><code>before_request()</code>: They are called before a request and pass no arguments.</li>
<li><code>after_request()</code>: They are called after a request and pass the response that will be sent to the client.</li>
<li><code>teardown_request()</code>: They are called in situation when exception is raised, and response are not guaranteed. They are called after the response been constructed. They are not allowed to modify the request, and their values are ignored.</li>
</ul>
